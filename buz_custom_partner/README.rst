Buz Custom Partner

This module extends the partner (res.partner) model in Odoo 17 to add additional fields and functionality:

* **Partner Code**: Automatically generated codes for customers (starting with 'C') and vendors (starting with 'V')
* **Old Partner Code**: Field to store legacy partner codes
* **Office**: Field to specify office location
* **Partner Group**: Field to categorize partners into groups
* **Partner Type**: Field to specify type of partner

The module integrates seamlessly with the existing partner form view and includes proper sequence management for partner codes.
