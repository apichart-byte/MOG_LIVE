MRP Unbuild Enhancement
=======================
Enhance Manufacturing Unbuild Orders for real manufacturing environments:

* Preview BOM components as editable lines before confirming
* Edit returned quantity per component
* Per-component destination location (multi-warehouse return)
* Skip damaged components (Receive checkbox)
* Scrap part of a returned quantity (real Stock Scrap records)
* Default return location per BOM line
* Per-component cost share (%), required: split the unbuilt product's
  actual (FIFO) consumed value across returned components instead of
  valuing each one at its own standard cost. Confirmation is blocked
  until the cost share of all received components adds up to 100%
* Smart buttons: Returned Moves / Scrap / Components
* "MRP Unbuild Manager" security group controls who can edit
  quantities, locations and scrap quantities
