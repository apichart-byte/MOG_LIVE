# Every period boundary in these reports is measured against the *accounting*
# date, not svl.create_date.
#
# create_date is when the row was inserted, and it is also the key
# stock.valuation.layer._run_fifo() orders its candidate queue by. The backdate
# wizards used to overwrite it so that transactions landed in the right period,
# which silently reordered the FIFO queue as a side effect — 11,286 layers on
# production have an id order that disagrees with their create_date order
# because of it. Those wizards now leave create_date alone and set the move
# date, so the two concerns are separated: create_date orders the FIFO queue,
# this expression buckets the period.
#
# The expression itself now lives on the layer as accounting_date (added by
# stock_fifo_by_location): seeded at create from the landed cost date or the
# move date, and rewritten by the backdate wizards. Deriving it here by joining
# stock_move meant the reports and the Stock Valuation list disagreed about a
# backdated layer's date; a stored column gives both one answer.
#
# A landed-cost layer carries the stock_move_id of the receipt it adjusts, so
# the seed prefers lc.date — the date the cost was actually recognised — over
# the receipt's move date. lc.date is a Date, and `D::timestamp` is D 00:00 UTC,
# which is D 07:00 in Bangkok — inside Bangkok day D, so it buckets correctly
# against the UTC bounds computed by _bangkok_day_range_to_utc(). Do NOT
# subtract the Bangkok offset when seeding; that would push every landed cost
# back a day.
#
# COALESCE to create_date still guards layers created before the column existed
# on a database where the backfill migration has not run yet.
