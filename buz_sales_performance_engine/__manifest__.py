BUZ Sales Performance Engine
===========================

Recognizes sales ONLY when all business conditions are satisfied:
  * Sale Order confirmed (sale)
  * Delivery done (stock.picking)
  * Customer invoice posted (account.move)

Partial delivery, partial invoicing, returns and credit notes are handled
automatically at the sale-order-line granularity via a summary table
``buz.sales.performance.result`` that the dashboard reads exclusively.

Features
--------
* Salesperson / Sales Team / Company targets (daily, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
* Real-time OWL pipeline dashboard (Chart.js, no extra JS dependency):
  KPI cards (Sales Order / Delivery / Invoice / Payment / POS Returns /
  Credit Notes / Backlog / Overdue),
  sales funnel, sales trend, sales by company / category,
  performance by salesperson with target achievement,
  top customers, follow-up work lists, month-over-month comparison
* Drill-downs to sale orders, deliveries, invoices, overdue invoices
* Event-driven incremental recompute + nightly safety-net cron
* Multi-company, multi-currency
* 3-tier security: own records / own team / all
