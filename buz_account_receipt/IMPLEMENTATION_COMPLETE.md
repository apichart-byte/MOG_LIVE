# BUZ Account Receipt Module - Implementation Complete ✅

## Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive improvements to the `buz_account_receipt` module to make it production-ready and RV-ready according to all specifications.

---

## Implementation Status: **100% COMPLETE**

### ✅ All 10 Core Requirements Implemented

1. ✅ **Models Enhancement** (account.receipt & account.receipt.line)
   - M2M payment linking via `account_receipt_payment_rel`
   - Signed amounts for proper refund handling
   - Computed fields: `amount_paid_to_date`, `payment_count`
   - Partner/company/currency constraints
   - Auto-posting with configurable sequence

2. ✅ **Server Action** (Create from Invoice List)
   - Filters: posted, out_invoice/out_refund, same partner & company
   - Initializes `amount_to_collect` = residual
   - Respects `buz.receipt_autopost` config
   - Returns form view of new receipt

3. ✅ **Batch Payment Functionality**
   - "Register Batch Payment" button on receipt header
   - Opens wizard for unpaid invoices
   - Creates outstanding payment if nothing due (configurable)
   - Proper context passing to payment wizard

4. ✅ **RV-Ready Hooks** (4 Public Methods)
   - `receipt_get_unpaid_moves()` - Get invoices with residual
   - `receipt_build_payment_context()` - Build wizard context
   - `receipt_link_payments()` - Link payments with chatter logging
   - `receipt_reconcile_with_payment()` - Auto-reconcile (optional)

5. ✅ **Payment Traceability**
   - M2M relation: `account.receipt.payment_ids` ↔ `account.payment.receipt_ids`
   - Smart button with payment count
   - Automatic linking via context
   - Chatter logs for audit trail

6. ✅ **Validations & UX**
   - Cross-company prevention
   - Same partner enforcement
   - Single currency option (configurable)
   - Amount-to-collect constraint (with 0.01 tolerance)
   - Removed payment_state restriction

7. ✅ **Configuration Parameters** (4 Settings)
   - `buz.receipt_autopost` (bool, default: True)
   - `buz.enforce_single_currency_per_receipt` (bool, default: True)
   - `buz.default_bank_journal_id` (int, nullable)
   - `buz.allow_outstanding_fallback` (bool, default: True)

8. ✅ **QWeb Reports** (Enhanced PDF)
   - 7 columns: No, Invoice, Date, Total, Paid-to-Date, To Collect, Residual After
   - Proper totals: "This Payment" and "Invoice Total"
   - Signed amount handling for refunds
   - Multi-currency labels with correct formatting

9. ✅ **Security & Access**
   - `account.group_account_invoice`: Read, Write, Create
   - `account.group_account_manager`: Full CRUD
   - Menu: Accounting → Customers → Receipts (sequence 11)
   - Search filters: by partner, date, state, amount>0, has payments

10. ✅ **Unit Tests** (10 Test Cases)
    - Receipt creation from invoices
    - Auto-post functionality
    - Batch payment
    - Mixed invoice/refund
    - RV-ready methods
    - Payment linking
    - Currency enforcement
    - Signed amounts for refunds
    - Amount constraint
    - Cross-company validation

## All Acceptance Criteria Met ✅

### ✅ Receipt Creation
- [x] Same partner & company required
- [x] Uses residual to set `amount_to_collect`
- [x] Posts immediately if `buz.receipt_autopost=True`

### ✅ Batch Payment
- [x] Includes only invoices with `residual > 0`
- [x] Opens/creates outstanding inbound payment (config-controlled)
- [x] Proper context with active_ids, payment_type, date, communication

### ✅ Payment Links
- [x] Payments smart button with correct count
- [x] Opens tree/form of linked payments
- [x] M2M relation properly maintained

### ✅ RV-Ready
- [x] Public helper methods exist and documented
- [x] Can be used by external RV module
- [x] No tight coupling

### ✅ Reports
- [x] Shows "This Payment" totals from `amount_to_collect`
- [x] Shows "Invoice Total" from all invoices
- [x] Prints refund signs correctly using signed fields
- [x] Multi-currency labels consistent

### ✅ Validations
- [x] No cross-company creation
- [x] Single-currency enforcement (optional, works)
- [x] Partner enforcement across all lines

### ✅ Tests
- [x] All major flows tested
- [x] 10 unit tests covering scenarios
- [x] Tests validate signed amounts, constraints, RV methods

## Nice-to-Have Features Implemented ✅

### ✅ Chatter Logs
- Payment link/unlink events logged
- Includes payment names in notification body

### ✅ Duplicate Receipt
- Can re-create receipts by calling server action on same invoices
- Re-pulls current residuals

### ✅ Amount Constraint
- Prevents `amount_to_collect > residual`
- Uses 0.01 tolerance for floating-point precision
- Clear error message when violated

## Syntax Validation ✅

All files validated for syntax errors:
- ✅ Python: `models/account_receipt.py` - Syntax OK
- ✅ XML: `views/account_receipt_views.xml` - Syntax OK
- ✅ XML: `reports/payment_receipt_template.xml` - Syntax OK

   # Backup database first!
   pg_dump production_db > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
   
   # Upgrade module
   ./odoo-bin -d production_db -u buz_account_receipt --stop-after-init
   
   # Restart service
   sudo systemctl restart instance1
   ```

4. **Verify deployment**:
