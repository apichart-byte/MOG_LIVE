# ✅ FK Constraint Fix - COMPLETED & DEPLOYED

## Issue: RESOLVED ✅

**Error Message (Before Fix):**
```
Validation Error

The operation cannot be completed: another model requires the record being deleted. 
If possible, archive it instead.

Model: Unknown (unknown)
Constraint: account_receipt_voucher_line_payment_rel_voucher_line_id_fkey
```

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED AND DEPLOYED**

---

## Solution Implemented

### Code Changes

**File:** `/opt/instance1/odoo17/custom-addons/buz_account_receipt/models/account_receipt_voucher.py`

#### 1. AccountReceiptVoucher.unlink() - Line 402
```python
def unlink(self):
    """Clear related payment M2M links on voucher lines before deleting the voucher.

    Deleting a voucher may cascade-delete its voucher lines at the database level,
    which can cause a FK constraint if the M2M relation table still references
    those lines. We proactively clear the M2M rows.
    """
    for voucher in self:
        # Clear links on each line to avoid DB FK errors during cascade delete
        for line in voucher.line_ids:
            if line.payment_ids:
                line.write({'payment_ids': [(5, 0, 0)]})
    return super(AccountReceiptVoucher, self).unlink()
```

#### 2. AccountReceiptVoucherLine.unlink() - Line 700
```python
def unlink(self):
    """Ensure Many2many links to payments are removed before deleting voucher lines.

    Postgres will prevent deleting a record that is referenced by a foreign key
    from the M2M relation table. We explicitly clear the relation rows so the
    voucher line can be removed (this mirrors an "archive instead" behaviour
    when needed).
    """
    # Clear m2m links to avoid FK restriction errors on delete
    for line in self:
        if line.payment_ids:
            # Remove all links in the relation table for this line
            line.write({'payment_ids': [(5, 0, 0)]})
    return super(AccountReceiptVoucherLine, self).unlink()
```

## What Was Fixed

### Root Cause
PostgreSQL foreign key constraint `account_receipt_voucher_line_payment_rel_voucher_line_id_fkey` prevented deletion of voucher lines because the Many2many relation table still referenced them.

### Solution
Added `unlink()` method overrides to both models:
1. **AccountReceiptVoucher.unlink()** - Clears M2M links on all lines before voucher deletion
2. **AccountReceiptVoucherLine.unlink()** - Clears M2M links before line deletion

### How It Works
- Uses Odoo command `(5, 0, 0)` to remove all M2M relations
- Runs before the actual record deletion
- Prevents FK constraint violations
- Does NOT delete payment records (only the links)

## Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: Delete Voucher with Payments
```
1. Go to Accounting → Receipt Vouchers
2. Open a confirmed voucher (with linked payments)
3. Click "Delete" (trash icon)
4. Expected: ✅ Voucher deletes successfully
5. Previous: ❌ FK constraint error
```

### Test Case 2: Delete Voucher Line
```
1. Go to Accounting → Receipt Vouchers
2. Open a confirmed voucher
3. Go to the "Lines" tab
4. Select a line and delete it
5. Expected: ✅ Line deletes successfully
6. Previous: ❌ FK constraint error
```

### Test Case 3: Draft Voucher (No Payments)
```
1. Create a new voucher (don't confirm)
2. Click "Delete"
3. Expected: ✅ Voucher deletes successfully
4. Note: No payments to clear, should work as before
```

## Verification Commands

### Check Module Version
```bash
grep "version" /opt/instance1/odoo17/custom-addons/buz_account_receipt/__manifest__.py
# Should show: "version": "17.0.2.0.0",
```

### Check Unlink Methods Exist
```bash
grep -n "def unlink(self):" /opt/instance1/odoo17/custom-addons/buz_account_receipt/models/account_receipt_voucher.py
# Should show:
# 402:    def unlink(self):    # AccountReceiptVoucher
# 700:    def unlink(self):    # AccountReceiptVoucherLine
```

### Check Service Status
```bash
sudo systemctl status instance1
# Should show: Active: active (running)
```

### View Recent Logs
```bash
sudo journalctl -u instance1 -n 50 --no-pager
```

## Important Notes

### What This Fix Does ✅
- ✅ Allows deletion of vouchers with linked payments
- ✅ Allows deletion of voucher lines with linked payments
- ✅ Clears Many2many relations automatically
- ✅ Prevents FK constraint errors
- ✅ Maintains data integrity

### What This Fix Does NOT Do ❌
- ❌ Does NOT delete payment records
- ❌ Does NOT affect payment reconciliation
- ❌ Does NOT change voucher creation workflow
- ❌ Does NOT modify existing payments
- ❌ Does NOT archive records (still hard delete)

### Data Safety
- Payment records remain in the database
- Only the M2M relation links are removed
- Payment history is preserved
- Audit trails in payments are intact

## Upgrade Script Created

**Location:** `/opt/instance1/odoo17/custom-addons/upgrade_buz_account_receipt.sh`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run the upgrade script anytime you need to upgrade this module
cd /opt/instance1/odoo17/custom-addons
./upgrade_buz_account_receipt.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. Stops the Odoo instance
2. Upgrades the buz_account_receipt module
3. Restarts the Odoo instance
4. Shows status

|------|---------|
| `VOUCHER_DELETE_FIX.md` | Complete technical documentation |
| `FIX_VERIFICATION.md` | Quick verification guide |
| `FK_CONSTRAINT_FIX_COMPLETED.md` | This deployment summary |
| `test_voucher_delete_fix.py` | Test script for validation |

## Support & Troubleshooting

### If Deletion Still Fails

1. **Check if module was upgraded:**
   ```bash
   # In Odoo UI: Apps → Search "buz_account_receipt" → Check install date
   ```

2. **Force module upgrade:**
   ```bash
   cd /opt/instance1/odoo17/custom-addons
   ./upgrade_buz_account_receipt.sh
   ```

3. **Check logs for errors:**
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u instance1 -f
   # Then try to delete a voucher in the UI
   ```

4. **Verify unlink methods are loaded:**
   ```python
   # In Odoo shell
   env['account.receipt.voucher']._get_method_list()
   # Should include 'unlink'
   ```
